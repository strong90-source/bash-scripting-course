# Exercise 4:

# Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it does exist, display "Shadow passwords are enabled."
# Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can, display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." If you cannot, display "
# You do NOT have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."


#!/bin/bash

if [ -e /etc/shadow ]

then
    echo "Shadow passwords are enabled."

    if [ -w /etc/shadow ]
    then
        echo "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
    else
    echo "You do NOT have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
    fi
